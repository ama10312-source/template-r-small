# Introduction

This paper aims to analyze the relationship between students' exam scores and various predictors such as hours studied, sleep hours, attendance percentage, and previous scores. @Doe found that hours studied and attendance percentage were significant predictors of exam scores [@Doe]. This analysis seeks to validate and extend those findings using a more comprehensive dataset.

# Data

```{r}
#| label: data cleaning
#| tbl-cap: Data summary

df <- df |> mutate(
  attendance_percent = attendance_percent / 100,
  previous_scores = previous_scores / 100,
  exam_score = exam_score / 100
)

datasummary_skim(
  df,
  fun_numeric = list(
    Mean = Mean,
    SD = SD
  ),
  escape = FALSE
)
```

# Results

```{r}
#| label: analysis
#| tbl-cap: Regression table

models <- list(
  lm(exam_score ~ previous_scores, data = df),
  lm(exam_score ~ hours_studied + sleep_hours + attendance_percent + previous_scores, data = df)
)
```
